# PyTest with Databricks

**pytest_easy** is a minimal and practical example of how to run unit tests on **Databricks notebooks** using `pytest`, without the need to access the terminal or CLI. It supports both **PySpark** functions and classic Python logic, making it ideal for data engineers and scientists working in distributed environments.

## 🚀 What It Does

- ✅ Demonstrates running `pytest` directly from **Databricks Notebooks**
- 🔥 Supports **PySpark** functions and traditional **Python** logic
- 📦 Includes reusable fixtures and helper utilities
- 🔍 Integrated with a clean `pytest.ini` config for ease of use

## 🧪 Use Case

This repo is designed for those who:

- Work on **Databricks** and want to unit test code *without* a terminal
- Need to test **Spark** transformations alongside pure Python functions
- Prefer structured, maintainable, and automated testing workflows

## 📦 Installation

Install dependencies directly at Databricks notebook level:

```bash
pip install pytest
```
